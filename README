any initial errors will probably be some missing library packages. read the errors and make sure you have the neceesary packages installed.


linux requirements:
python 3
pip install tkinter numpy matplotlib
for linux/ubuntu tkinter may be installed by apt rather than pip
sudo apt-get install python3-tk 
sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk





how to use: 

1) two image paths to mix
2) the "top left" coordinate for each image (0,0) default
3) experiment with the one parameter, cutoff
4) hit compute (it will look like nothing's happening...)
5) hit preview
6) mess with the parameters and ***hit compute again***, then preview again 
7) save when you're ready
8) try mixing your result with a new image



note: use the preview window to help see the (x,y) coordinates for the images
